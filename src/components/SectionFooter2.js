        1 Chime SpotMe is an optional, no fee service that requires a single
        deposit of $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime
        Checking Account each month. All qualifying members will be allowed to
        overdraw their account up to $20 on debit card purchases and cash
        withdrawals initially, but may be later eligible for a higher limit of
        up to $200 or more based on member's Chime Account history, direct
        deposit frequency and amount, spending activity and other risk-based
        factors. Your limit will be displayed to you within the Chime mobile
        app. You will receive notice of any changes to your limit. Your limit
        may change at any time, at Chime's discretion. Although there are no
        overdraft fees, there may be out-of-network or third party fees
        associated with ATM transactions. SpotMe won't cover non-debit card
        transactions, including ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, or Chime
        Checkbook transactions. See Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the
        submission of the payment file from the payer. We generally make these
        funds available on the day the payment file is received, which may be up
        to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.
      </p>
      <p>
        3 Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a
        7-Eleven location or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM. Other fees
        such as third-party and cash deposit fees may apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        4 Based on a representative study conducted by Experian®, members who
        made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and
        October 2020 observed an average FICO® Score 8 increase of 30 points
        after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a
        positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact
        your credit score.
      </p>
      <p>
        5 To apply for Credit Builder, you must have received a single
        qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more to your Checking Account. The
        qualifying direct deposit must be from your employer, payroll provider,
        gig economy payer, or benefits payer by Automated Clearing House (ACH)
        deposit OR Original Credit Transaction (OCT). Bank ACH transfers, Pay
        Anyone transfers, verification or trial deposits from financial
        institutions, peer to peer transfers from services such as PayPal, Cash
        App, or Venmo, mobile check deposits, cash loads or deposits, one-time
        direct deposits, such as tax refunds and other similar transactions, and
        any deposit to which Chime deems to not be a qualifying direct deposit
        are not qualifying direct deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
        6 Sometimes instant transfers can be delayed. The recipient must use a
        valid debit card to claim funds. Once you are approved for a Chime
        Checking Account, see your issuing bank’s Deposit Account Agreement for
        full Pay Anyone Transfers details. Please see the back of your Chime
        debit card for your issuing bank. See Terms and Conditions <br></br>7
